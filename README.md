#A Rule-Based Chatbot is an artificial intelligence application that interacts with users using pre-defined rules and decision trees. Unlike machine learning chatbots that learn from data, this chatbot uses if-else logic or pattern-matching rules to respond to user queries. It follows a fixed set of conditions to deliver accurate and predictable responses.
